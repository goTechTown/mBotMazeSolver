# mBotMazeSolver
Program to solve a maze using an mBot robot.
The end of the maze is determined by a black stripe on the floor, wide enough to be detected by the mBot.

Requires an ultrasonic sensor to be mounted on a servo.

"Written" in mBlock (Scratch) but uploaded as Arduino code so it is standalone.

Code was written by Aram Perez under contract to The TechTown Foundation.
